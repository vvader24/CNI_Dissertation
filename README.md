Cultural Normativity Index, A Profile Similarity Approach

Academic Abstract:
Cultures are marked by a sharedness – similarity in beliefs, values, moral codes, patterns
of thinking and feeling – among other things. This sharedness is unequally distributed within the
members of culture. But how do we measure this sharedness? Based on the distributive model of
culture, and person-environment fit framework, this thesis identified a Cultural Normativity
Index (CNI) – the extent to which an individual approximates to their societal aggregate.
Employing a multilevel profile similarity approach, CNI is assessed across two broad
psychological domains: Mindset (beliefs, values, norms) and Personality (trait tendencies, based
on the Big Six) using item pools drawn from a variety of measures covering a broad area of the
domains across two studies. Six and eight CNI types based on Mindset and personality domains
were assessed in each study respectively. In Study 1 (N = 2,224) CNI was strongly associated
with GLOBE (Assertiveness, Future Orientation, Ingroup Collectivism) and Big Six
(Agreeableness, Resilience, Extraversion, Conscientiousness, Originality) measures and weakly
associated with subjective well-being. In Study 2 (N = 8,588) strongest associations with CNI
were observed with the Big Two (Dynamism, Social self-regulation) and Values (Openness to
Change, Self-Transcendence). Majority of the strongest associations were observed at the
country-level. In Study 2, CNI was also found to be associated with place of family homes (urban
vs. rural), mother’s and father’s education, and age. Furthermore, differences across CNI-types
with respect to the varied associations with measures are discussed.

Overview:
This study proposes the deviation from the normative profile as a way to compute a cultural normativity index that can be further used to model cultural differences between populations. 
The (dis)similarity from the normative has important implications for cross cultural research
